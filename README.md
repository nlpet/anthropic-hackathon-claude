# InisghtWire

InisightWire is a project that uses AI in order to help us make sense of the News. Its aim is to introduce nuance and multiple perspectives, and enable us to entertain multiple points of views when we make up our minds about current events.

This was originally a Hackathon project, for more information, please check out this [post](https://devpost.com/software/insightwire).

Stay tuned for updates & new features.
